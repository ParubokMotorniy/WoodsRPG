# WoodsRPGðŸŒ²âš”
Two-level RPG with detailed scenes and dynamic combat system along with AI-basics. 

Here are some of the features of the game:
 - plausible AI. In other words, the enemies follow different behaviour patterns and are controlled by the game.
 - UI
 - game data saving 
 - character progression
 - tweakable stats of the enemies and weapons  
 - adjustable game balanceâ€¦

I also pride myself on creating ***quite realistic levels*** that immerse the player into the game's world.

**Note**: I do not author any of the visual assets used in the project.

Instructions: 
 - D - delete save file 
 - S - save game (the next time you launch game it will be loaded from this save file)
 - Hold the right mouse button to rotate the camera 
 - Click the left mouse button to pick an item/attack/walk/shoot 
 - Eat beet to healðŸ¥—
